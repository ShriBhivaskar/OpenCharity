============ Introduction ============
This small project is a test project to understand the ability of the developer to know-how of CSS styling and Drupal Themeing. 
The test project is developed as part of face website of OpenCharity and GeekLabel.

============ About OpenCharity ============ 
Open charity is an organization that hosts events in London about open source software and solution for charities. The website is designed fully in basic HTML and CSS. No use of any advanced frmework like Bootstrap, Foundation W3CSS etc has been included while coding for the website. The major issue, I faced is that of the font-family. I researched a lot and discovered that Museo Sans font-family is available only on purchase. Though, I have included the google apis font link. I hope you consider this website to the very near design of the proposed design. I have tested this code on Firefox 50, Google Chrome 55, IE 10 and adjusting the window size for mobile-responsive design. You may directly visit http://supershrinivas.com/drupal/sites/all/themes/OpenCharity/home.php and see the live design of OpenCharity website. I tried my best to complete the tasks.
